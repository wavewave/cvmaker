We show that atomic parity violation constraints disfavor t-channel models while not producing too large a top cross-section and conclude that the parity violation constraints are very important for such model building. |

We examine the essential observables of these models for top physics at LHC7 with 1 fb$^{-1}$ of data, including the total cross-section, invariant mass distribution and number of additional jets in t tbar events. We conclude that LHC7 top analyses are rapidly closing the window for viable models of the CDF top $A_{FB}$. |

We compare the collider phenomenology of mirage mediation and deflected mirage mediation, which are two recently proposed "mixed" supersymmetry breaking scenarios motivated from string compactifications. The scenarios differ in that deflected mirage mediation includes gauge mediation contribution in addition to the contributions from gravity mediation and anomaly mediation in mirage mediation. |

We consider a degenerate or a nearly degenerate dark matter sector where a sizable magnetic moment of an almost Dirac type neutral dark matter candidate is anticipated. Then, due to soft photon exchange, the cross-section in direct detection can be enhanced at low momentum transfer region. We discuss the implication of this type of models in view of the recent CDMS II report. |

We propose a novel generalized method for mass measurements based on the singularity structure of the kinematic phase space that can be applied to any event topology with missing energy. We provide a systematic way to obtain optimized singularity coordinates for the process of interest.  Our method subsumes the well-known end-point and transverse mass methods and yields new and powerful techniques for studying ``missing particle'' events at the LHC.  |

The resulting 
R parity violation in these models is not in conflict with the current observational bound on 
proton decay. |

  title: String compactification, QCD axion and axion photon photon coupling
  journal: JHEP  \textbf{\small 0703}, 116 (2007) 
  abstract: 
We found that in a certain class of heterotic string models based on
$\scriptstyle Z_{12-I}$ orbifold compactifications, an approximate Peccei-Quinn symmetry
with a small PQ breaking scale can result. This allows for the interesting
possibility of a realistic axion within this class of string models. |

  title: Mediation of supersymmetry breaking in gauge messenger models
  journal: JHEP \textbf{\small 0610}, 001 (2006)
  abstract: 
We proposed a class of models called gauge messenger models 
in which the messenger fields are GUT X,Y gauge multiplets at low energies.
This scenario results in negative stop masses at high energies, 
as well as large A terms and small gluino masses at low energies, which significantly reduces the Higgs sector fine-tuning in the MSSM. |

  title: Modification of decay constants of superstring axions: Effects of flux compactification and axion mixing 
  journal: Phys.\ Lett.\  B  \textbf{\small 639}, 342 (2006)
  abstract: 
We showed that the recent discovery of the existence of heterotic flux 
compactifications can have implications for reducing the scale of the axion 
decay constant from the string scale to an intermediate scale, 
due to warping. We also pointed out that axion mixing effects must be 
considered when lowering the axion decay constant scale. |

  title: Fayet-Iliopoulos terms in 5D orbifold supergravity
  journal: JHEP \textbf{\small 0409}, 001 (2004)
  abstract:
We constructed complete 5D off-shell supergravity theories with 
Fayet-Iliopoulos terms within orbifold compactifications.  We used the 
4-form multiplier mechanism and considered both flat and warped 
geometries. The 
formulation was applied to the issue of radion stabilization. |

  title: Flavor hierarchy from extra dimension and gauge threshold correction
  journal: Nucl.\ Phys.\  B \textbf{\small 687}, 101 (2004)
  abstract:
We showed that in orbifold GUT models where flavor mixing originates from the 
quasi-localization of matter fields in the extra dimension, there are 
sizable corrections to the low energy gauge couplings. 
We calculated the threshold corrections at one loop order, and suggested
flavor $\scriptstyle U(1)$ charge combinations which do not spoil the 
MSSM gauge coupling unification. |

  title: Supersymmetry breaking in warped geometry
  journal: Eur.\ Phys.\ J.\  C \textbf{\small 35}, 267 (2004)
  abstract:
We presented a general analysis of SUSY breaking in models with a geometric
separation between observable and hidden sectors, and showed that 
flavor dependent SUSY breaking can be effectively suppressed even in the 
quasi-localized case. We applied our formulation to examine the 
consequences of flavor violating trilinear terms in radion mediation. |

  abstract:
We presented a general analysis of the one-loop gauge couplings in 
non-supersymmetric warped extra dimensions, including scalar, fermion and
vector contributions with arbitrary boundary conditions. Our work
is now widely used as a standard result in GUT model building in 
warped extra dimensions. |

We calculated the one-loop gauge couplings in both flat and warped extra

theories. This paper provided the first comprehensive result of the 
one-loop gauge couplings in warped geometries. |
