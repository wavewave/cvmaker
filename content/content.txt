paper {
  authors: M.~I.~Gresham, I.~W.~Kim and K.~M.~Zurek
  title: On Models of New Physics for the Tevatron Top $A_{FB}$
  journal: accepted for publication in Physics Review D
  arxiv: arXiv:1103.3501 [hep-ph]
  abstract: We analyze various models that could generate the top 
$\scriptstyle {A_{FB}}$ asymmetry. We show that t tbar events in 
$\scriptstyle {Z'_H}$ and $\scriptstyle {W'}$ models have considerably 
lower selection efficiencies in high invariant mass bins as comparedto 
the Standard Model.   We find that the models that successfully
generate the corrected CDF asymmetry at the parton level reproduce
very well the more finely binned uncorrected asymmetry.
